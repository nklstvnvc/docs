June was an exciting month for Attrace:

The IDO referral and landing page have been released (including Blockpass KYC), and within 48 hours the IDO on MISO was sold out.

With this, the first Decentralized Referral Promotion has been completed, where multiple influencers used the Attrace Referral Network to earn commission for their promotions.

This gave the team the desired result:
- Exposure which resulted in strong increase on all social media accounts and website traffic
- The Referral Network has proven the viability of the dApp promotion use case.

For the Referral Network to function properly, the ATTR price needs to be available (relative to the native coin of the external network, like ETH). In other words, the ATTR/ETH price needs to be exposed in order for the verifier nodes to calculate the gas fees.

Next step is to list ATTR on a DEX, not only to give more exposure to the solution, but to really start implementing the Referral Network with different partners.

The mission of Attrace is to become the referral standard of the tokenized economy. In order to do so, the following steps need to be taken:
- Connect new blockchains 
- Extend use cases
- Bring in new partners
- Become more DAO
- REPEAT!


### Technical updates
- The referral marketplace has been moved to production ([market.attrace.com](https://market.attrace.com)), the Attrace team is working to make all NFT functionality available in coming weeks
- Referral link shortener put on the roadmap
- Many speed and js lib optimizations.
- IPFS deployment improvements
- Contract improvements in terms of gas usage and functionality

### Upcoming: Attrace Contract Indexer
In order for the referral marketplace and other apps to be performant, the Attrace Team identified the need to have a fast, queryable service. Therefore the development started on the Attrace Contract Indexer. The contract indexer will parse the external network blocks for transactions and logs, after which it will put the result in a simple database, categorized by event type.
