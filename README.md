### Installation

```console
yarn install
```

### Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Verifying builds

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

This happens automatically on merge.
